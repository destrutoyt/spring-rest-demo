# Spring REST API Demo

This project demonstrates how to design and build **RESTful APIs** with the **Spring Framework**.  
It connects to a **MySQL database**, retrieves and manipulates data, converts it into **JSON**, and exposes it through REST endpoints that can be consumed by web applications or other clients.  

The application showcases key backend development skills, including:  
- üöÄ **Building REST APIs with Spring Boot**  
- üóÑÔ∏è **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**  
- üõ¢Ô∏è **Database integration with MySQL using Spring Data JPA**  
- üîÑ **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)**  
- üì¶ **Data serialization with Jackson (JSON)**  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exception handling & validation**  
- üèóÔ∏è **Layered architecture (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)**

## Project Details

### API Requirements
The API provides a simple **Employee Directory** service. REST clients can:  
- Get a list of employees  
- Get a single employee by ID  
- Add a new employee  
- Update an existing employee  
- Delete an employee  

### API Endpoints
| HTTP Method | URL | CRUD Action | Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **POST**   | `/api/employees` | **Create** | Add a new employee |
| **GET**    | `/api/employees` | **Read**   | Fetch all employees |
| **GET**    | `/api/employees/{employeeID}` | **Read** | Fetch employee by ID |
| **PUT**    | `/api/employees/{employeeID}` | **Update** | Update employee details |
| **DELETE** | `/api/employees/{employeeID}` | **Delete** | Remove employee |
